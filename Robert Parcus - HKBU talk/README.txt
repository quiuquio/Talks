Dear Visitor,

here you will find the slides for a talk I did for the 
UNIPG - HKBU exchange program in 2013, about HTML5, CSS,
javascript and mobile devices.

To see the slides, just open the file
"Phonegap and Html5 on Mobile Devices - Part II.html"
with your favorite web browser. The slides are like a website
which you can navigate.

In the 'www' folder, you will find the code for the jQuery 
app I did as an example.

For any questions, do not hesitate to contact me!
